SMS Backup &amp; Restore Tools for Windows

This is a tool built to read, display and split the XML backups created by the Android app SMS Backup & Restore by Ritesh Sahu

I also took some inspiration from this Java tool, but haven't tried it: http://devadvance.com/sms-backup-reader/

I built this tool mainly to split out the one big XML created by the Android app into single XML files per contact. I know you can also achieve this by creating each backup individually with the app, but that seems a bit tedious if you are planning to do it on a regular basis.

You can grab the binary (executable) from the binary folder. No installation required, you can just run it.

Features
--------
  * Read XML file generated by SMS Backup & Restore
  * Group messages by contact, displayed in a data grid
  * View messages for each contact
  * Delete contacts
  * Merge contacts - this is useful if a contact has changed numbers or some messages have the phone number in international format and others don't. For display, the contact with the latest (newest) message is considered the master
  * Export messages for a single contact
  * Export messages for all contacts: This prompts you to select a folder and will generate one XML file per contact
  * File exist options: Merge, overwrite, cancel - Merge will eliminate duplicate messages and add new messages (ordered by date)
  * The exported XML files have the same format as the original from the app and also reference the xsl stylesheet for display in the browser

Currently missing - possible future features
--------------------------------------------
  * Handle MMS - Sorry! I haven't uses MMS in years, so haven't bothered including this as I have nothing to test with
  * Delete individual messages
  * Edit contact name in data grid
  * Make a program icon ;)
  * Start using version numbers

PS: Sorry for the basic UI and probably poor UX. My background is in web development, so I pretty much just threw this together.
